"While mental health has become a more prominent issue recently, I feel like there is still a lot of stigma surrounding it. At this point, with our culture, I would not bring it up.

"Same reason as above.","Yes","Male",11
"It isn't relevant to my ability as a programmer.","Yes","Male",12
"Also seems highly likely to be irrelevant at the point that I am in an interview.","Yes","Female",13
"Too private.","Maybe","Male",14
"Because Of the potential for discrimination","Yes","Male",15
"I don't think it's appropriate to discuss those issues during early interviews. I'd wait to discuss with HR after I have a feel for what's going on.","Yes","Male",16
"I have found their reaction to be a good indicator of whether our ideals are aligned / whether it's a good fit for me as a workplace.","Yes","Female",17
"bad idea","Yes","Female",19

"Again, only if it could effect my job performance","No","Male",25
"Same reason as above.","Yes","Male",27
"I think most employers would straight up discount me for that","Maybe","Female",29
"See above","Yes","Other",30
"Depending on the exact nature of the issue I might think they wouldn't want to hire me","Yes","Other",31
"Seems unnecessary. It's asinine to bring up unnecessary conversation ever.","Yes","Male",32
"Again, when properly coped with it shouldn't affect my ability to do the job. I expect, as with physical health issues, I'll be allowed time needed when coping is necessary.","Maybe","Male",33
"Same as before","No","Male",34
"It's no different from a physical health issue. If it can potentially affect my performance then I should be clear.","Yes","Male",35
"same as before","No","Male",36
"Same answer as for physical health issues, though admittedly I'm a little slower to bring up mental health concerns due to stigma fears.","Yes","Male",37
"Because my employer needs to support me in order to get the best work possible from me","No","Male",40
"In most regards it doesn't concern the employer, if it becomes an issue then I'd be willing to discuss it.","Yes","Male",41
"For me, it depends on how the interview is going - if it's clear that it's a dead end, I would not bring it up.","Yes","Male",42
"Too easy to map mental health to ability to do the job.","Yes","Female",43
"Seems like it would deter them from hiring me.","Yes","Male",46
"I think the only time would be with \"on call\" work (i.e. Being available 24/7 with no set schedule) as this causes far too much stress in my life. I refuse, and have quit, jobs that rely on this method. The job that I quit was promised to have a schedule in the interview.","Yes","Male",47
"There's likely nothing they could do to mitigate any performance problems as a result of a mental health issue, so I probably wouldn't discuss.","Maybe","Male",48
"Would want to know if management support is going to work.","Maybe","Male",49
"Not related to my qualifications or skills","Yes","Female",50
"mental issues are a bit stigmatic, everyone knows it's there but no-one wants to deal with it. A broken leg isn't that big a deal, but a broken mind is abstract.","No","Male",53
"I understand that, while they might consciously not act differently if I had a mental health issue, I'm not at all convinced that people in tech, even those who know what Cognitive Dissonance means, will actually take steps to avoid it.  Furthermore, there's a huge stigma behind it.","Yes","Male",54
"Because, if it were a mental health issue that might affect my job performance, it may be easy to hide, while being forthcoming about it might impact my likelihood to get the job in the first place.","Maybe","Male",55
"Same reasons.","No","Female",56
"The stigma of the topic.","Maybe","Female",59
"If it got in the way of work, it if I needed some accommodation, I would, but, otherwise, it wouldn't seem worth it.","No","Male",60
"same thing: If it has impact or if it's visible at work, why trying to hide.","Maybe","Male",61
"If it would have a direct impact on my ability to perform the role I would feel compelled to mention it, but depending on how understanding I expected the employer to I might not, due to the negative consequences.","Maybe","Male",62
"Won't get the job.","Maybe","Male",64
"Disclosing that cannot help you get the job","No","Male",65

"Don't know, feeling","No","Male",76
"It's a weakness; and you mostly want to talk about your strenghts","No","Female",78

"Stigma","Yes","Male",93
"Same response as the physical one.","No","Male",94

"Stigma.","Yes","Male",101
"If it was relevant to the position.","No","Male",102
"Same answer as before. I prefer to use an interview as an opportunity to learn more about a potential employer and to showcase my skills. I wouldn't want to waste that valuable time on the minutiae of my health.","No","Female",103
"It _could_ way into being hired, instead of skills","Maybe","Male",104

"None of their business","Yes","Male",111

"I think there is a general feeling of \"you should be able to manage that\" via some employers and this is not where I would want to test that. I might bring up mental health coverage during an interview though.","No","Female",121
"Are you serious right now? I would never in a million years discuss my mental health issues. I don't need my new employers judging me off the bat and having a reason to not give me the job because someone equally qualified who doesn't over share and talk about their problems is given the job instead of me. I also am lucky that work is a place where I often function better than I do at home. Personally, I do better when I don't allow myself the option to give into depressive episodes at work. But that's just my experience. I've worked at companies where my supervisor knew I was dealing with depression and addiction recovery and it didn't help me at all. He didn't understand and I made it easier for myself to slack off. At my new job I haven't told anyone and Even though I think they'd be more supportive and understanding, I feel better that I keep my personal issues out of the work place. Though I understand completely that other people who have mental health issues are not as lucky to be as functional as I am.","Yes","Female",123
"It would likely result in a negative opinion of me, and my ability to perform the job, and might also be communicated beyond the person performing the interview. It's not a potential employers business if it doesn't effect my ability to do the job, and I value my privacy.","Yes","Female",124
"I assume that chronic mental health issues, like chronic physical health issues, would often affect hiring decisions, even though employers won't say so.  I'm diabetic, and have observed discrimination on the physical health side of things.","Maybe","Female",125
"It's a very personal thing, to talk about a mental health issue. It is harder to talk about because it forces me to tell you something that you otherwise might never know, unlike a physical ailment which could be visible or become visible over time without my consenting to share it.","Maybe","Female",126
"Because it would impact the relationship (I might need certain freedom or personal space for example) and I believe honesty up front to be the best approach.","No","Male",127
"Same reason, if it does not affect my job skills, interviewer does not need to know. Otherwise, I might tell about it.","No","Male",128
"I don't want to get passed over.","No","Female",129
"Afraid to add something negative to the balance sheet","Maybe","Male",130
"There is zero upside to bringing it up. There is no foreseeable circumstance in which bringing it up forestalls a problem or leads to opportunity.","Maybe","Male",131
"It carries a stigma","Yes","Male",132
"I would be afraid it would jeopardize my chances","Yes","Male",133
"Would only bring it up if it affected my ability to do the job.","No","Male",134
"Again, unless it somehow directly impacts my work it's nobody's business","No","Male",135
"I think it could negatively impact my candidacy for the position.","Maybe","Male",136
"Depends on the issue at hand. Would it affect my performance or would it require adjustments? Then, yes. If not, then I probably wouldn't.","No","Male",137
"Never. Absolutely never. This would be stigmatized to hell.","Yes","Female",138
"Same as above. Things like \"please send an agenda w/HR meetings, because anxiety\" usually come up after hire, not at interview time, IME","Yes","Male",139
"Jeopardizes getting the job","Yes","Other",140
"I do not want health issues to effect how I am perceived in an interview.","No","Female",141
"Risk of not getting an offer","Maybe","Female",142
"may not get hired","Yes","Male",143
"I'm already deaf. I have a lot working against me in the interview process already.","Yes","Female",144
"Because it's none of their business.","Maybe","Male",145
"Mental health issues are hugely stigmatized.  I made the mistake of letting my last employer find out that I had ADHD and an adderall prescription not really thinking about it.  The head of engineering would joke about me \"doing meth\" after that at horrible moments including me (I have no degree) interviewing a PhD candidate who had done groundbreaking work in SMP and threaded rendering at SGI in the 90s and was all around awesome.  Luckily he made a joke about not talking about the shrooms he did to lighten that one, but there were many worse situations.  I was considered one of the most valued employees because of my ability to get anything done with the LLVM compiler system.  One day I pointed out to the manager in question that he was on a higher dosage of the same medication I was on, and the stupid meth jokes got worse from there.  It's not really a light accusation to make on somebody given our country's state of drug law, something which I am something of an activist for reform of.  It was was degrading. I was also made fun of for being autistic despite that not being a disorder I have.","Yes","Male",146
"As above, but with added stigma that mental health issues are seen as not serious (and therefore bringing it up is itself would be considered a problem), or as incurable and therefore at least as big a liability as a physical problem.","No","Male",147
"It depends on the reputation of the employer","Yes","Male",151
"Would not get hired","No","Female",152
"I would be reluctant to bring up a mental health issue for fear that it could reduce my chances of getting the job.","Maybe","Male",153
"There is absolutely no way it could help, and a lot lot lot of ways it could hurt. And even though I should be protected by non-discrimination laws, if someone did use it in their decision-making, I'd have virtually no recourse.","Yes","Female",154
"Not their business","No","Male",158
"Could contribute to employment decision (legal or not)","No","Male",159
"It would be judged as a risk.","Yes","Male",160
"They might think I'm a complainer","Yes","Female",161
"None of their business as long as I feel I can perform my work","Yes","Female",162
"Supervisors don't like to deal with those sort of issues.","No","Female",163
"Only if it is relevant for the work.","No","Female",165
"If it impacts the work, they should know about it.","Maybe","Male",167
"I'm not sure if it'd harm my chances, but I wouldn't want to give anyone more reason to not hire me","Maybe","Male",169
"Would be concerned at the negative stigma","No","Male",170
"Stigma.","No","Male",171
"I feel it would negatively effect my ability to get the position","No","Male",174
"I would be afraid it would negatively impact my chances.","Yes","Female",176
"I would want to set expectations of my ability from the start","No","Male",177
"It might be important to know how they react to such things.","No","Male",179
"depends if it's relevant","No","Male",180
"Usually not relevant","Maybe","Other",181
"It's none of their business until it affects my work","No","Male",182
"That is a slippery slope. In my opinion your chances of getting the job are much less if you bring up mental health issues.","Yes","Male",183
"I don't have one, so it's hard to relate","No","Male",184
"Concern it could overshadow other issues","Yes","Male",185
"I would likely prefer to wait until the offer stage to discuss mental health issue / accommodations, rather than in the interview","No","Female",186
"same","Yes","Male",187
"Wouldn't want marks against me","Maybe","Male",188
"It depends on how open the potential employer is about mental health","Maybe","Male",190
"If it would make me seem less suitable for the job","Yes","Female",193
"I'd worry that the reaction would not be one of understanding and that it would count against me during the selection process.","Yes","Male",194
"It hard. There is still a stigma around mental health problems and people faking it, certainly around my home town.","Yes","Male",196
"I would not because I am very concerned that it would negatively affect my chances for employment.","Yes","Male",198
"I wouldn't bring it up unless absolutely necessary for my day-to-day job function, out of fear of discrimination or not being hired.","Maybe","Female",199
"Same as physical health reason really. Coupled with the fact that nowadays I feel it's even more important to highlight mental health issues rather than sweeping under the carpet.","No","Male",200
"Because I am open about being a mental health advocate - it's one of the reasons I am good at my job.","Yes","Female",202
"Stigma.","Maybe","Male",203
"if it wasn't relevant","No","Male",204
"Again, wouldn't want it to be held against me compared to other candidates.","Yes","Male",206
"Same reason as above","No","Male",208
"Depends on whether or not I feel it would impact my ability to do the work on a regular basis.","No","Male",210
"Stigma.","Yes","Female",211
"Same reason, it may affect my productivity.","No","Male",213
"Yes, If can affect work","No","Male",216
"cos I have a lot of crap in my head and i am ashamed about it","Yes","Male",218
"I like to be open about it up front","Yes","Male",219
"Only if it required immediate accommodation.","No","Male",221
"Less chances of getting the job, plus negative references for the future.","No","Female",222
"Mental health is still stigmatised enough and not protected enough it could result in my not getting a job I wanted.","No","Male",223
"Seems too private to share","No","Female",224
"I imagine they will dismiss my application","No","Male",225
"I don't know if I would do that.","No","Male",226
"Not sure. That would depend a lot on the company I would be interviewing with.","Maybe","Male",227
"same reason as above. it's my problem and my business alone.","Yes","Female",228
"They absolutely do not need to know this before i start. I feel like this is a huge HR issue and the less they know the better honestly. I am very dyslexic  and  have a learning disability but it does not effect how i preform at my job","Yes","Female",229
"I prefer to keep nothing hidden","No","Male",230
"Stigma.","No","Female",232
"Feel it would prevent hire. Only if asked point blank.","Yes","Male",233
"Same as any issue, I'm looking for employers that enjoy me exactly as I am. Not some glossed up version of myself","No","Male",234
"depending of the place and the mental health issue ...","Maybe","Male",235
"Has the potential to look like you are whining.","Maybe","Male",237
"It might affect my performance and relations with the colleagues","No","Male",238

"Fear of discrimination.","Yes","Female",249
"Even with more education on mental health, there is still a stigma and negative outcome in the work place if one is known to be 'on medication'.","Yes","Female",250
"I need to establish trust with my employer before I would be willing to discuss my mental health, especially if it was not actively affecting my work performance at the time of the interview.","Yes","Female",251

"I worry it would affect my chances of employment","Maybe","Male",255
"Naturally, I'd be afraid that they wouldn't hire me.","Yes","Male",256
"I would not want to appear weak or unstable.","Maybe","Male",258
"Again, check my baggage at the door. My ADHD and general anxiety are well-managed enough that most of the time, they'll never have to worry about it anyway. At the same time, I'm proactive about bringing it up at my current gig, because I don't want it to be a \"new thing\" if I'm suddenly in a bad way.","Yes","Male",259
"Same as above","No","Male",261
"See above","Yes","Female",262
"Stigma","No","Male",264
"The stigma of mental illness is something that I am not sure I feel most employers would be willing to look past in an interview. I'm already a woman, which some view as a burden (will she need to leave for childcare? is she as capable of this job as her male counterparts?) and adding the additional 'burden' of having a mental health issue seems like it'd stack the cards against me.","Yes","Female",265
"Never know what they will do with that information","No","Female",266
"Because the employer would use it to measure how competent/high maintenance I was","Yes","Female",267
"I'd have to feel it out in the interview and see if I felt comfortable discussing it. It's a tough call. I wish I could just feel comfortable doing it all the time.","Yes","Male",271
"See previous.","No","Male",272
"suspect it would  stop  me  getting  job","Maybe","Male",273
"I feel as if there is a stigma against mental health issues in general. I am loathe to even discuss it with my wife.","Maybe","Male",275
"I wouldn't know if I needed accommodations. Also shame. Probably more shame.","Maybe","Male",277
"I'd only bring it up if I felt comfortable & also would need accommodations. But probably a lot less likely to bring it up than a physical health issue.","No","Female",278
"My problem to work with, not theirs","No","Male",279
"Personal health issues don't belong in the interview process, as it inherently makes the interview particularly hostile to the interviewee and their organization (because HR law, especially as relating to anti-discrimination, is a thing).","No","Male",280
"Mental health issues are still a taboo subject.","Maybe","Female",281
"Fear of discrimination","Yes","Male",283
"It's my problem, not theirs.","Yes","Male",284
"because it gets equated with mental competency and makes you look bad","Yes","Female",285

"There is mental health issues in my family","No","Female",297
"Would feel it may have an effect on the chance of employment","No","Male",298
"it would depend on the severity of the condition, and to what extent it would affect my capability to work","Maybe","Male",299
"It may affect the hiring managers decision if I bring this up. Although, an interview is about ensuring the employer is a good fit for me too. So I would have to consider my options at the time.","Yes","Male",300
"Mental health is not seen as an issue by most employers.","No","Male",302
"Mental health is either not taken as seriously as physical health or is viewed negatively.","Yes","Female",303
"It _may_ affect the outcome of an interview, so I'd be reluctant to bring it up","No","Male",304
"I need to know they understand. I don't want to work for someone who doesn't understand.","No","Male",305
"I don't think I need it.","No","Female",306
"Would be too much of a negative","Yes","Male",307
"My physical health problems are less stigmatized.","Yes","Male",308
"none of their business unless it actively limits my activities, at which point I probably wouldn't be interviewing anyway","Yes","Female",309
"very much depends on what the line of questioning leading to that was and the nature of their line of enquiry","Yes","Male",310
"There is still too much stigma attached to mental health and the possibility for discrimination is too high. I might disclose it *after* being hired and passing any probationary period.","Yes","Male",312
"I have enough counting against me in an interview without adding to the number of biases weighted against me.","Yes","Female",314
"I depends on what degree it affects my work. If it affects how I work I would want to be up front about that.","No","Male",315
"Could definitely be seen as a weakness and a reason why you wouldn't be as productive as someone without the issue.","No","Male",316
"Would only hurt you","Yes","Male",317
"It's not relevant to my ability to perform the job responsibilities.","No","Male",318
"Don't have one personally, but the same logic applies. Mental health isn't respected or understood well by anyone and I don't see how it would be to my advantage to disclose.","No","Female",319
"If it was going to effect my position, I would bring it up.","Yes","Female",320
"Again, it would depend on the relevance. If a mental health issue would in any way effect my life at a the potential job, I would much rather be upfront about my needs and requirements from my employers than try to hide it. If I thought it was irrelevant to the job, I probably wouldn't bring it up during an interview.","No","Female",322
"Only if I had a firm belief that there would be no negative consequences.","No","Female",324
"I would be afraid that it would result in me not being chosen for the position.","Yes","Male",325
"Like i said before, i think that there are so many prejudices and ignorance about mental health","No","Male",326
"I am from India. IMO mental illness is not looked upon in an accepting way here. If I have an mental health issue, I would be skeptical to talk about it as it might affect my prospects.","No","Male",327
"i would not want to give ANY reason for disqualification","No","Male",328
"I am scared it may scare off potential employers to be honest. I guess it really depends on the person that is sitting across the table and how comfortable I'd feel.","Yes","Male",329
"The stigma associated with mental health colors the judgement of potential candidates.","Yes","Female",330
"For all the reasons you already know.","Maybe","Male",331
"Concern about it's impact on hiring","Maybe","Male",333
"For the same reason.  If it effects my work, they need to know.","Maybe","Male",334
"I don't think mental health issues are well understood and the negative stigma might cause my interview to end negatively","Yes","Female",335
"I would say it depends on what it is. Generally speaking, I would be hesitant to bring up any mental health issue in an interview situation, but there are circumstances which could change my mind.","Maybe","Male",336
"Same as above","Yes","Female",337
"Same, depends on the relevance to my function","Yes","Male",338

"It could mean time off/etc and the employer should be infomred","Yes","Male",340
"Seems irrelevant and embarrassing","Maybe","Male",342
"I would not want to work for an employer that reacted negatively to a mental health issue. I think it's a good test to ensure that they're the kind of employer I'd want to work for.","No","Female",343
"I think a potential employer would definitely see a mental health issue as a reason not to hire me.","Yes","Female",344
"employers may see it as a cost","Maybe","Male",345
"Unsure","No","Male",346
"It depends on whether or not it would affect my job.","No","Female",347
"Could compromise my ability to get hired or look like a compelling candidate","Yes","Male",348
"Many organizations look for any reason to reject a candidate during the interview process.","Maybe","Male",349
"Too great a stigma. Would likely be rejected for another candidate.","No","Male",350

"Why risk implicit or overt bias?","Maybe","Male",453
"Because I fear repercussions including not being hired","Yes","Female",454
"Because of the nature of our work, mental health issues are far more impactful. If I thought it needed to be accounted for, I would involve the potential employer to ensure they can work with me.","Maybe","Male",455

"Reaction would tell a lot of the type of employer they are.","No","Male",485
"If was relevant to the job, then yes. But I do think that discussing mental health in a job interview is more risky (because of the negative perception it could create) than discussing physical health issues.","Yes","Male",486
"I feel that a mental health issue would not be something I'd want them to take into account as part of the hiring process, unless it were a serious enough issue that I wouldn't want to work for an employer who was not willing to make accommodations for my issue.","Maybe","Male",487
"They are still stigmatized and without obvious mentions of acceptance by the employer beforehand I would worry that there would be hidden (or not so hidden) prejudice.  Again I would worry about being written off for the job.","Maybe","Female",488
"Depression is my entire life. Work shouldn't be my life.","Yes","Male",489
"It has no legal bearing on the hiring process","Maybe","Male",490
"Not having a mental illness, I assume there is a stigma around the issue for people who haven't experienced it.","No","Male",491

"Same reason mostly. Though probably depend on particular issue and how it may affect the work life","No","Male",513
"I would bring it up because I think it's not right to hide it, even for yourself, you could have an increased stress from trying to hide the disorder which could make your disorder even worse than it should be. Also if a company isn't willing to hire you because you suffer from a mental disorder, it's probably a company you wouldn't want to work for.","No","Male",514

"I'd bet they wouldn't hire me","Yes","Female",517
"Mental health issues can and often do effect our ability to perform.","No","Male",518
"They would immediately give the \"short interview\" and show you the door. That's career suicide. What if someone said \"I'm manic depressive, sometimes I can't get shit done because I'm too depressed. Other times I'll get more done in 4 hours than your entire team will in a week.\" Most companies are going to think you're nuts.","No","Male",519
"Because as a techie your main  tool is your brain. And i would fear that people would see my mental health issue as a maldunction and value my abilities less","Maybe","Male",520
"It doesn't matter at that point in my opinion. Ultimately I feel, although third parties can greatly help you with mental health troubles, it is ultimately yourself and your perspective on things that has to change and thus it's a very personal battle.","No","Male",521
"Now you've got me...! I think not previously knowing said interviewers would dissuade me, not knowing how it would affect my outcome, although I would know that I should be addressing it with them.","Yes","Male",522

"I don't feel comfortable talking about mental health issues at all, even less with a stranger interviewing me.","Maybe","Male",532
"It would be a weird thing to volunteer in an interview. I wouldn't want a candidate to tell me about any issue, because it puts me in a bad spot if I decline to offer them a job.","Yes","Female",533

"Depends.","Yes","Female",573
"I'm a private person in general, I may not bring it up.","Maybe","Male",574

"Having occasional depression myself, I'm well-versed in the potential negative (work-related) effects (e.g. trouble focusing, potential for oversleeping, etc.).

"Depends on wether I feel comfortable enough during the interview or when they bring it up in a non-threatening way.","Yes","Male",597

"I do not think that they would understand, and it would affect their decision.","Yes","Male",715

"Would be concerned I wouldn't be considered for the position.","Maybe","Male",726
"It would be considered strange. I am already a minority, I don't need more negative things counted against me in an interview.","Yes","Female",727
"I am bi-polar. For many people, their only understanding of bi-polar is the mass shooter on the nightly news. That is so far from the reality of most bi-polar people that it's like saying because you drive a car you must be a drunk driver.","Yes","Female",728
"Same as before, it would really depend on the circumstances.","Maybe","Male",729
"Sure","No","Male",732

Also it feels harder to explain potential absence due to a mental disorder.","Yes","Female",754

"There's a still very prominent stigma against mental health and that anyone with a mental illness is \"crazy.\" Some people would brush it off and understand that it's just like having asthma—an illness that we have to take medication for and we can live normal lives with it.

"I'd be concerned that if I mentioned my generalised anxiety issues it may lead them to believe that I am not a confident worker (which I almost certainly am). Basically - I'd fear they wouldn't properly understand! A lot of people are incredibly ignorant to anxiety and just end up telling you 'not to worry' about parts of your day to day that may make one feel anxious etc.","Maybe","Male",807
"Because of the stigma around my ability to do my job, cope, etc.","Yes","Female",809

"Not sure.","No","Male",826

"Less likely, simply because the general perception and knowledge about mental illnesses is less widely understood. For instance, Adult ADD might be simple to explain, whereas Bipolar II would be a longer discussion and may be avoided in an interview.","Yes","Male",828

"I am currently an opiate addict and will be for as long as I live. I have not used in 3 years. It still messes with me to this day. I do not think I would ever be comfortable sharing that with an employer. Its not documented anywhere that I am an addict so there would be no reason to share such a thing to an employer. Most people do not realize that I have something wrong with my brain chemistry not that I am a terrible person or want to be this way. I do great work and I have had my current job for 6 years. But I feel like if I told any employer that I would be discriminated against or eventually let go.","Yes","Male",842
"I think it would negatively impact the interview.","No","Male",844
"Depends on relevance to performance","Yes","Male",845
"Of fear of being regarded as weak or unable to perform job tasks. Requiring time off for \"fake\" reasons.","Yes","Male",846
"In my experience, many people see mental health as a lesser issue than physical health, and one that can fixed if they \"man up\" or grow up. I worry that mentioning a chronic mental health issue would be viewed as a detriment and a weakness to my work.","Maybe","Male",847
"It may affect my being hired","Yes","Male",848

"Seems more private than a physical issue.","No","Male",852
"That would be job suicide.","No","Male",853
"The stigma makes me wary of bringing up mental health issues during an initial interview. I feel like the more I get to know a job and it's people, that determines how comfortable I am with being open about my mental health. I feel like it's too risky to bring up in an interview where both parties don't know one another well enough. I have anxiety and depression, which can also include focus/motivation issues. I feel like mentioning things like this would give the impression that I'm not a good employee who can get things done. However that's not true. I am very responsible and will meet deadlines so long as I can work when I'm most productive and there are flexible schedules.","Maybe","Female",854
"I feel it's best to be candid in an interview, however mental health issues are still a stigma — I'd likely play it by ear and balance the decision of whether to bring it up during an interview based on the tone and thoroughness of the interview.","Maybe","Male",855
"A negative count against me for the job","No","Male",856
"I feel like it would effect my chances of getting a job. It's also none of their business unless it effects my performance.","Maybe","Male",857

"afraid of stigma, being seen as less capable","Yes","Female",863
"Haven't thought it through","No","Male",864
"I would want to steer away from this as stress is the common denominator in all jobs and stress triggers panic and potentially depression. I've had employers bail and then the family who I was supporting as well.","Yes","Male",865

"Same as physical: I don't feel that it is their business and although they should not take it into consideration when hiring, let's be honest, they do.","No","Female",871
"There is still a stigma around mental health issues. The interviewer's perception of my skills and capability to perform the required tasks of the role may be altered because of this (even though I wouldn't have the job yet).","Maybe","Female",873
"That's private information asked none of their business.","Maybe","Male",874
"This would be more difficult because I think people do not understand and are more biased against mental health issues than physical ones, and I'd be concerned they'd find another pretext for not hiring me.","No","Male",875
"not sure - you usually don't know the ppl interviewing you","No","Male",877
"I would bring it up only if I would need accommodations in order to do my job.","Yes","Female",878
"See above. Also, it's analogous to bringing up my black wife or gay son.","Maybe","Male",879
"It would depend primarily on the issue and whether I deemed it relevant to the interview/position.","No","Female",880
"There's too little understanding or sympathy around mental health. I'd be labeled \"crazy,\" and that'd be the end of the interview.","Yes","Male",881
"I am a veteran with PTSD-related issues. I believe in total transparency. If it's not appreciated, then I know the potential employer is not for me.","Yes","Male",882

"Because I try not to let it affect my work.","Yes","Female",897
"Same reason as before. Add to that the stigma associated with mental health. Not a good idea. I think employers, especially big companies, see mental health issues like depression as undesirable.","No","Male",898

"Almost certainty it would impact negatively on getting the position.","No","Male",901

"Not unless I was aware how they felt about mental health.","Yes","Male",907
"Similarly to physical issues, only if I felt I needed accommodation.","Yes","Male",908
"Dependant on how comfortable I felt speaking the interviewer(s), dependant if they have mentioned there is an avenue/approach they embrace to address mental health issues. Dependant on how my mental health is that day/week/ etc","Maybe","Female",910

"I would worry that bringing up a mental health issue would have negative consequences.","Maybe","Male",1078

"I would bring up a mental health issue in an interview if it affected my ability to work, healthcare coverage, or schedule. However, unlike physical health issues, it seems clear that mental health issues are strongly affected by stress -- to that end, I would feel comfortable asking about the working conditions of the workplace are such that they actively promote finding the most optimum balance between stress and productivity.","Maybe","Male",1111

"See my answer above. I don't want to risk a possible position or cast a pall over the rapport with a potential coworker. I didn't always feel this way, but at my last position I got strongly warned, in secret, never to say anything about my condition because people would think I was 'crazy' and 'might shoot up the place.' I have major clinical depression that I've managed and treated for years. The only person it's hurt is myself. But that was the perception of anyone with a mental illness, never mind that they're as wide a spectrum as physical illnesses. So I never said anything.","Yes","Female",1181

"Same reasoning as above, but with more nuance: Software engineers are hired in part because of their intelligence and apparent mental fitness.

"Same answer as physical","Yes","Female",1239

"I feel it could have a bearing on if I got an offer of employment even though it is illegal to discriminate based on mental health issues.","Maybe","Male",1257

"So while this could definitely directly impact my ability to do the job, I would be really afraid to mention it to interviewers. I'm sure there are situations where i might mention it, but in the abstract, I wouldn't bring it up (my mental image of interviewers is kinda veering toward matrix looking fellas in suits)","Yes","Female",1264

I'm still mad about it even though I kind of get it from their standpoint. They even made me turn in a doctor's note that they're keeping on file.
